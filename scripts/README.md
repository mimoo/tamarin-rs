# scripts/ — parity gates, caches, and triage tools

Per-script reference. For *which* gates to run and in what order, start from
the verification ladder in [`../TESTING.md`](../TESTING.md).

Every script compares the Rust port (`target/release/tamarin-rs`) against the
patched Haskell oracle (`../tamarin-prover-testing/`, built by
`./setup.sh testing`). Result TSVs land in `results/` (gitignored).
Most scripts take `ALLOWLIST=` (file of corpus-relative paths) to run a
subset, and `RS_PATH=`/`HS_PATH=` to point at other binaries.

**Build the port first.** Every gate checks an in-tree `target/` binary against
Cargo's dep-info (or a conservative source fallback) and refuses a stale one;
`ALLOW_STALE_BIN=1` is the deliberate override. An external/sealed `RS_PATH`
cannot be attributed to this checkout by its timestamps, so it is content-
fingerprinted for the duration of the run but its source provenance remains
the caller's responsibility. `target/release/tamarin-rs <theory> | grep
'^Git revision:'` says what a gate actually measured.

## The HS reference caches

Five, all gitignored, none keyed alike:

| Cache | Fed by / read by | Key |
|---|---|---|
| `.gate_cache/proof/` | `corpus_file_diff.sh` | theory inputs + flags hash + **oracle/execution fingerprints**; the oracle's exit status sits beside each entry as `.rc` |
| `.gate_cache/load/` | `pretty_gate.sh` and `wf_gate.sh` | theory inputs + flags hash + **oracle/execution fingerprints** |
| `.gate_cache/web/` | `web_parity.sh` writes; `pane_byte_check.sh` reads | profile = **oracle + execution + Graphviz/URL-key + shell producer protocol SHA-256 + crawl plan/settings**; entry = theory inputs |
| `.gate_cache/raw/` | `diff_proof_raw.sh` and `corpus_raw_diff.sh` | theory inputs + lemma + cache version + **oracle/execution fingerprints** |
| `.gate_cache/sweep/` | the three flag sweeps | theory inputs + flags + **oracle/execution fingerprints** |

Persistent cache identities use the Haskell release/revision and attested patch
series, the Maude version and derivation-check timeout, and (for web crawls)
the Graphviz version. Rebuilding the same tool version on another platform
does not invalidate cached output. Executable hashes are retained only for
source-attestation checks and detecting replacement during a running gate.
Unchanged executable metadata avoids repeated hashing during a run; changed
metadata triggers a content check. The web cache uses the crawler's explicit
`PLAN_VERSION` capture contract. Bump it for changes to routes, captured bytes,
or ordering of stateful requests; timing-only edits do not invalidate captures.
Full crawler source hashes still detect edits during an active run. The cache
also fingerprints the URL-key helper and loaded staging/invocation protocol
because they determine which response bytes enter the manifest. The protocol
hash covers producer functions, not unrelated comments, cache plumbing, or
comparison code. It
deliberately excludes the HTTP request deadline: a successful complete manifest
is independent of how long the caller was willing to wait. Thus the harness preserves
and automatically reselects caches for alternating Tamarin builds.
Manifests record their actual configurable per-run work roots; comparison maps
both roots to one token so a warm HS crawl does not differ from a later RS crawl
merely because `mktemp` chose another directory. The full response normalizer
and `web_diff.py` affect only the live comparison, so their fingerprints guard
each verdict without invalidating HS manifests. Diagnostic bundles replace a
traversal-safe, hashed per-theory namespace only after that identity check; an
all-MATCH rerun therefore removes stale diff files.
All five caches live below the main/common worktree's gitignored
`scripts/.gate_cache/`, even when launched from a linked worktree.
`TAMARIN_RS_CACHE_ROOT=` moves the whole pool. On first use, an old cache in
the main checkout is renamed into its named subdirectory when that destination
does not exist; other worktree-local legacy caches are preserved and reported
for manual import. Old flat `.web_hs_cache*`
entries cannot prove their Maude/derivation/Graphviz producer and are therefore
left in place but not promoted into a current profile. Cache entries are locked per key and published
atomically, so fills and readers may run concurrently across worktrees. Rust
binaries are not cache producers and therefore do not enter these keys; each
gate fingerprints its selected Rust executable separately and rejects a
verdict if those bytes change while the comparison is in flight.
`CACHE=` overrides the exact directory, with the same producer-profile checks
as default caches. Existing web manifests without a `PROFILE` are refused. `WEB_CACHE_ROOT=` moves the web profile pool. Large per-run
manifest copies live under `target/web-work` rather than `/tmp`; set
`WEB_WORK_ROOT=` to move them. Nothing is archived or wiped, and
`bump_submodule.sh` deliberately leaves the caches alone.
`./setup.sh testing` also stamps the binary with the submodule pin, the
ordered patch-series SHA-256 and the binary SHA-256, both beside the executable
and at a fixed `.stack-work/` location. Comparing gates can therefore verify a
byte-identical `HS_PATH` copy while rejecting an arbitrary dirty-tree rebuild
at the right base commit.
All five caches digest transitive `#include` inputs and executable oracle
inputs. The web cache stages both dependency classes through one helper shared by both consumers.
Manifest path fields use reversible hexadecimal bytes, keeping tabs, newlines,
and non-UTF-8 Unix filenames out of the line-oriented protocol delimiters.

`gate_common.sh` owns the shared plumbing: the OOM prologue, the three
environment-line strip policies (`strip_env` deletes all four volatile lines,
`strip_env_lines` keeps `analyzed:` for the triage tools, `norm` blanks to
placeholders for the sweeps), `flags_for`/parser-backed dependency hashing/
`ckey`, `input_content_key`, `binary_sha256`/`hs_fingerprint`/
`execution_fingerprint`,
`allowlist_guard` + the gate `filelist`, `rs_stale_check`, `oracle_rev_check`,
the Haskell-oracle resolver and the maude resolver — `MAUDE_PATH` if set
(set-but-unusable is a hard fail,
never a silent fall-through), else `maude` on `PATH`, else the linuxbrew
install, else a hard fail naming all three steps; `maude_on_path` then
prepends the RESOLVED binary's own directory, so an operator's maude wins over
linuxbrew instead of being overridden by it. Every gate here sources it, the
three flag sweeps through `sweep_common.sh`, and so do the cache-touching
triage tools (`diff_proof_raw.sh`, `corpus_raw_diff.sh`,
`triage_diff_vs_hs.sh`) plus `capture_cli_refs.sh`; a consumer that cannot
read it exits 2 rather than falling back to a private copy. The
`proof_diff_common.sh` additionally owns the one `.gate_cache/raw` key and
nested-comment-aware lemma scanner shared by the raw and canonical proof-diff
tools. The remaining structural helper (`corpus_diff_proof_trees.sh`) and
`divergence_fixtures/_common.sh` keep their own small
setups.

`capture_cli_refs.sh` deliberately does not use the shared maude resolver: it
walks the RS test harness's ladder because its captures must use the maude
`cli_e2e.rs` will.

## Primary gates — run these before trusting a change

- **`corpus_file_diff.sh`** — the ground-truth batch gate: byte-diffs full
  `--prove` stdout for all 432 corpus files against the HS cache (generating
  missing cache entries from the oracle). Slow (~30–60 min cold); run at
  milestones or with `ALLOWLIST=` for touched families. It also compares the
  two sides' EXIT STATUS: the oracle's rc is cached as `<key>.rc` beside its
  stdout, and identical bytes under a different status are `RC_DIFF`, a failing
  row (`RC_UNKNOWN` counts entries predating that channel and is not a
  failure). Its first five TSV columns remain the summary contract; columns
  six and seven record the exact input identity and normalized RS output SHA
  used to certify a later reference generation. It is the heaviest thing here — `JOBS=4` oracles at `-N4 -M11g`
  plus four Rust provers, up to ~44 GB of GHC heap — and carries the shared
  `oom_prologue` (`oom_score_adj=1000` plus a 24 GiB `ulimit -v`) like the
  other gates, which every child inherits. It resolves one maude up front and
  exits 2 when nothing resolves; the selected path is passed explicitly to
  both provers. Empty unexplained oracle runs are not cached. Lower `JOBS` on
  a constrained box rather than raising it.
  `TIMING proof` lines on stderr report input hashing, cache decompression,
  Rust proving, normalization/input rechecks, and comparison in milliseconds;
  phase totals include the Haskell cache-validation/fill pass. Per-file timings
  describe work across concurrent workers, so their sum is not wall time.
  `ALLOWLIST` defaults to `scripts/parity_corpus.txt`, falling back to
  `$PREV_TSV`'s first column only when that file is missing too.
- **`wf_gate.sh`** — fast (~45 s over the whole corpus on 24 cores)
  wellformedness gate: diffs only the theory-load warning block, no proving.
  Run on every build. Its reference is `.gate_cache/load/`'s `<key>.load.gz`
  (the whole stripped load-time stdout), which its own PHASE 0 fills where
  missing — one cheap no-prove oracle load per file, shared with
  `pretty_gate.sh`, so a bump no longer costs a 30–60 min batch refill before
  this gate can compare anything.
- **`pretty_gate.sh`** — fast theory pretty-print gate (same ~45 s): diffs the
  load-time `theory … end` echo against the oracle. Run when touching parsing
  or printing. Its PHASE 0 fills the same `.load.gz` artifact and derives its
  `.theory.gz` slice from it; `NO_HS_FILL=1` skips the fill for a warm cache,
  and turns a cold one into an all-`SKIP` (failing) run. Both gates need the
  oracle binary even cache-warm — its fingerprint is part of the cache key —
  and exit 2 without one, `NO_HS_FILL=1` included. `wf_gate.sh` caps its fill
  separately (`HS_FILL_TIMEOUT`, 420 s) from the RS side's `FILE_TIMEOUT`
  (120 s); `pretty_gate.sh` uses one `FILE_TIMEOUT` (420 s) for both. Both
  DISCARD a timed-out load instead of caching partial stdout
  (the file SKIPs and is retried, so raising the cap needs no cache surgery),
  and report `--diff` theories directly as `SKIP_UNSUPPORTED_DIFF`, so
  the outcome does not depend on which gate ran first.

  All three carry their verdict in the exit status and repeat it on the last
  line (`verdict=`, with a trailing `files=<n>` — the count actually
  compared, which `rs_ref_check.sh generate` reads): nonzero on a DIFF, on any `SKIP_*` row (a file whose
  bytes were never compared, which a DIFF count of 0 cannot distinguish from
  a match), on `RC_DIFF` (`corpus_file_diff.sh` only: identical stdout,
  different exit status), and on `ROW-COUNT=rows/N` — all three count their
  file list up front, so a file that produced no row at all (a child killed
  by the OOM guard leaves no DIFF and no SKIP) still fails the run. A
  set-but-unreadable `ALLOWLIST` is `exit 2` in all three rather than a
  silent fall-through to the whole 432-file corpus, as is one that resolves to
  zero entries — the whole-run form of comparing nothing, which a `verdict=OK`
  over an empty histogram would otherwise read as a pass.
- **`web_parity.sh`** — interactive-mode gate: crawls both web servers per
  theory and diffs the responses — pane/JSON semantically, graph routes
  byte-for-byte. Runs two theories concurrently by default (`JOBS=1` for
  serial execution). Each worker adds 2 to `HS_PORT`/`RS_PORT`, so the defaults
  reserve ports 3021–3024. Increase `JOBS` cautiously: each server has its own
  memory cap, and large response manifests can exceed a GiB. Results are
  collected per worker before applying the ledger once to the whole run.
  Each free worker takes the next theory from a shared queue.
  `WEB_FETCH_JOBS=2` overlaps read-only proof/graph requests within each theory
  after autoproving and sitemap discovery; other links (including proof-method
  applications) remain sequential. Set it to `1` for serial fetching (range
  1–16). Results retain sitemap order. Fetch concurrency does not change the
  capture contract and therefore shares the same Haskell cache profile.
  `TIMING web`, `TIMING crawl`, and `TIMING compare` lines report
  startup, initial pages, autoproving, sitemap discovery, final page fetching,
  manifest writing/loading, comparison, and shutdown. Each server lifecycle
  reports its total; `TIMING web_gate total_ms` reports the whole invocation,
  including setup and bookkeeping. The proof gate likewise reports
  `TIMING proof total_ms`. Times are milliseconds. Server lifecycle checks
  poll every 100 ms; timeout settings remain in seconds.
  HTML comparison preserves the original bytes, including comments, doctypes,
  closing-tag spelling, and malformed markup. The parser only locates text
  for version/timestamp normalization; it never repairs or reserializes HTML.
  JSON responses compare fields individually, skipping normalization for equal
  strings. Only `html`, `title`, and `alert` fields receive HTML-aware environment
  normalization; other strings remain text. Work-directory normalization uses
  each manifest's recorded root, without guessing legacy temporary paths.
  Run on server changes. `ALLOWLIST=` is REQUIRED (one
  corpus-relative path per line; `ALLOWLIST=seed` is the built-in 2-file smoke
  list, and the full cached set is the milestone sweep) — it used to fall back
  to the seed list whenever it was unset or misspelt, which turned a
  certification run into a 2-file one without saying anything. The verdict
  fails on DIVERGENCE and VACUITY both: DIFF/MISSING rows are matched
  mechanically against the machine-checked residue ledger
  `websweep_ledger.tsv` (documented rows rewrite to `LEDGERED` with their
  class; anything still DIFF/MISSING fails as `UNDOCUMENTED`), `SKIP_*` rows
  and files that produced no comparison row fail as vacuity, and ledger
  entries that excuse nothing (LEDGER-STALE / LEDGER-SHADOWED / a path that
  has left the corpus) fail the run too. `CAPPED_*` rows (a crawl truncated
  at MAX_NODES) are always printed on the verdict line and fail only under
  `FAIL_ON_CAPPED=1`. Its results TSV is 7 columns —
  `file url status hs_http rs_http kind class`, `class` being the ledger class
  of a `LEDGERED` row and `-` elsewhere. Cached HS manifests are reused only
  from the automatically selected oracle/settings profile, with a sidecar
  check as defence in depth. Switching oracle binaries reselects the earlier
  profile instead of overwriting it; incomplete flat-cache identities are not
  promoted into current profiles.
  `WEB_LEDGER` picks another ledger, or `none` to run without one (which makes
  every DIFF undocumented by definition); an unreadable or malformed ledger is
  `exit 2` before any crawling, with file:line diagnostics. `ALLOWLIST` files
  may carry `#` comments and blank lines (both dropped), as they may for
  `pane_byte_check.sh`, which also collapses duplicates.
- **`pane_byte_check.sh`** — byte-exact (not just semantic) check of the
  `main/message` + `main/rules` panes against the web cache. Run when byte
  fidelity of pane HTML matters. The file list is REQUIRED (positional or
  `ALLOWLIST=`) — there is no default, because the old default was
  `websweep_residual.txt`, the set where a DIFF is *expected*. The verdict
  (exit status + `DONE_PANE_BYTE_CHECK` line) fails on DIFF, `MISSING_*`,
  any `SKIP_*` (including `SKIP_STALE_CACHE`, a cached manifest whose
  `.hs.fp` sidecar is absent or names another oracle binary), and on any
  shortfall against the expected two-rows-per-file count.
- **`rs_ref_check.sh`** — CI parity gate: `check` compares one binary's
  stripped `--prove` output hashes against the committed reference
  `ci_ref_fast.tsv` (what the `rs-parity` CI job runs on every PR), and also
  walks the reference in reverse so a row that never ran (shrunk allowlist,
  lost child) fails as `NOTRUN`; `generate` rewrites that reference from the
  selected Rust binary — manual, needed only after a deliberate output
  change, a submodule bump, or a Maude version change (the pinned version is
  recorded in the reference header and enforced — both the `generate` header
  line and the `check` handshake probe the RESOLVED maude, so the version
  compared is the one this run's provers actually use), and it now REQUIRES
  `--certified-by <gate-results>`: a saved oracle-gate log whose last
  `verdict=` line is `DONE_CORPUS_FILE_DIFF verdict=OK` and carries the exact
  relpath/input-key scope and normalized proof-output aggregate being baselined.
  `generate` recomputes that aggregate and refuses different bytes. A wf, pretty or flag sweep covers a
  different output surface; a same-sized different allowlist is also refused.
  Its path/verdict plus the oracle and execution
  fingerprint — checked against the submodule pin and ordered patch series via
  `oracle_rev_check` — are stamped into the reference header; `check` also
  requires those recorded source identities to match the current gitlink and
  patch series. CI compares
  against this committed oracle-certified snapshot rather than running
  Haskell. It therefore covers exactly the certified fast corpus and cannot
  establish general parity beyond it. The broader gates above remain local;
  `--certified-by` prevents a re-baseline from blessing Rust-only output.
- **`pe_sweep.sh` / `module_sweep.sh` / `json_sweep.sh`** — flag-parity
  sweeps for `--partial-evaluation`, `-m/--output-module`, and
  `--output-json`/`--output-dot`. Built on `sweep_common.sh`: oracle outputs
  are cached content-keyed under `.gate_cache/sweep/` (timeouts cached with
  their cap), so re-sweeping after a Rust change costs only the Rust side;
  a stale `target/release` binary aborts the run (`ALLOW_STALE_BIN=1`
  overrides), where "stale" spans cargo's whole dep-info list, not just
  `crates/**/*.rs` — `tamarin-prover/data/intruder_variants_{dh,bp}.spthy`
  are `include_str!`ed into the binary. An oracle not attested as the
  `setup.sh` build of the submodule pin plus current patch series is refused
  up front (`ALLOW_ORACLE_REV_MISMATCH=1` overrides). Documented residuals
  live in `sweep_expected.tsv` and report
  as LEDGERED — any bare DIFF/ERROR row is a regression, and an entry that
  has stopped excusing anything is called out on stderr (LEDGER-STALE /
  LEDGER-UNMATCHED / LEDGER-DUP) AND counted into the verdict, so it gets
  dropped rather than sitting in the ledger as a mask waiting for the file to
  regress under it. An entry names the one
  SYMPTOM it excuses (`stdout`, `stderr`, `rc`, `json`, `dot`, `timeout/kill`)
  in its 6th column, so a file ledgered for a stderr divergence still reports a
  fresh stdout regression beside it as DIFF. Three of the four ways to compare
  nothing are NO-COMPARE, which fails the sweep rather than counting as
  agreement — and "produced anything" is judged on what survives the
  normalizers, so two runs whose only bytes are lines `nerr` drops do not count
  as having agreed. `FAMILY=1` restricts to the per-sweep
  `*_family.txt` subset (one representative per divergence class, seconds on
  a warm cache) for inner-loop iteration; the full corpora are the milestone
  runs.

  **The fourth way is timeout/kill, and it reports as `UNCOMPARED`.** A
  timeout is fenced off as ERROR before `nocompare_check` is reached, so
  `apply_ledger` decides its fate — and a ledger-matched row that is ERROR, or
  whose entry names the `timeout/kill` symptom, terminates as `UNCOMPARED`
  rather than `LEDGERED`. Writing a timeout into `sweep_expected.tsv` therefore
  buys documentation, not agreement. `sweep_finish` lists up to 40 of them
  under `== n row(s) UNCOMPARED — a documented timeout/kill reached no verdict
  on them ==` and puts the count on the sentinel:
  `== DONE <sweep> <ts> verdict=<...> UNCOMPARED=<n> files=<n> ==`, always
  present, `UNCOMPARED=0` on a run with none (`files=` is the distinct
  compared-file count `rs_ref_check.sh generate` reads to reject scoped
  logs). It is deliberately NOT fatal — `verdict=` keeps its old meaning, so
  `grep -oE 'verdict=[^ ]+'` still works on these logs — and it puts "the
  files it compared agree" on the DONE line rather than leaving it to be
  inferred from the ledger. Today's ledger yields 23 such
  rows (pe 19, json 3, module 1). On the 15 `pe oracle-timeout` ones the port
  is never executed at all — the sweeps return on `hs>=124` before invoking
  `$RS_BIN` — and since `hs_run` caches a timeout together with its cap and
  serves it whenever the new cap is no larger, both the parallel pass and the
  600 s serial retry return 124 instantly on every future run; `LEDGER-STALE`
  cannot rescue them either, as it fires only when a row comes back OK. An
  UNDOCUMENTED timeout is unchanged: plain ERROR, counted into `DIFF/ERROR=n`,
  and the sweep fails.

- **`state_audit_gate.sh`** — the cross-fork gate for `--state-audit`, and
  the only gate whose reference side is NOT the pristine oracle. The mode is a
  ZKSec-branch addition, so the reference is our **Haskell fork's** build of
  it: `HS_PATH` must name that binary, and the gate exits 2 (rather than
  reporting every file as a DIFF) when the binary it is given has no
  `--state-audit`. Both sides run over the same theories; it compares the
  `summary` block, every lemma's name/quantifier/prover_status/audit_outcome/
  steps, and the process exit code. Deliberately not compared:
  `processing_time_seconds`, the run-local `input_file`/`trace_file` paths,
  and the serialised bytes — object-key order is not part of the schema
  (aeson does not preserve the written order, `serde_json` sorts), so both
  reports go through a JSON parser rather than a text diff. `SKIP_TIMEOUT` is
  a failing status: a run that reached no verdict is not agreement. Env:
  `RS_PATH`, `HS_PATH`, `CORPUS` (a file list; default is the in-repo
  `state_audit.spthy` fixture, whose four lemmas cover all four conclusive
  outcomes), `FILE_TIMEOUT`, `RESULTS_TSV`.

## Web-gate internals (invoked by the gates, rarely by hand)

- **`web_cache.sh`** — shared complete-producer profile selection, canonical
  input keys, theory/include/oracle staging, and guarded server boot/crawl/
  shutdown lifecycle for both web gates. Legacy
  flat entries remain separate because their producer identity is incomplete.
- **`web_crawl.py`** — crawls a running server into a response manifest.
- **`web_diff.py`** / **`web_normalize.py`** — semantic manifest diff and the
  normalizer it uses. HTML, `dot`, and `text` routes compare byte for byte
  bar the env-volatile tokens, because
  the port serialises both verbatim and whitespace is content there — the
  `source`/`message` panes carry the pretty printer's own trailing spaces.

## Triage tools — when a gate reports a DIFF

- **`diff_proof_raw.sh`** — one file, per-lemma raw `--prove` diff; the first
  stop for isolating which lemma diverges.
- **`corpus_raw_diff.sh`** — per-lemma raw diff across the whole corpus.
  Superseded as a gate by `corpus_file_diff.sh`; still useful when you want
  lemma-level granularity in a sweep.

  Both auto-build with `cargo build --release -p tamarin-prover` (the package;
  the binary it produces is `tamarin-rs`). `TAM_RS_NO_AUTO_BUILD=1` skips that
  and uses the binary as found.

  Both also strip a *narrower* set than the gates do — three volatile lines,
  keeping `analyzed:` — so a diff confined to that line is an artefact of the
  triage tool, not a finding.

  Both carry the gates' OOM prologue (`oom_score_adj=1000` plus a 24 GiB
  `ulimit -v`, inherited by every prover child), as does
  `triage_diff_vs_hs.sh`: a prover that outgrows the cap dies alone — in the
  corpus sweep as a `SKIP_RS_ERR` row — instead of taking the session with it.
- **`compare_parity_tsv.py`** — diff two `corpus_raw_diff` TSVs to list
  regressions/improvements between two runs.
- **`rs_vs_rs_diff.sh`** — sweep TWO Rust binaries (pre/post refactor, via
  `PRE=`/`POST=`) over the corpus with no HS involved; proves a refactor
  behaviorally inert.  Applies `file_flags.tsv` per file, defaults to the
  parity corpus, and reports prover failures as `ERROR_*` rows rather than
  scoring identical failure output as agreement. The verdict (exit status +
  `DONE_RS_VS_RS verdict=` line) fails on any DIFF and on every row that
  compared nothing — `ERROR_*`, `TIMEOUT_*` (including `TIMEOUT_BOTH`:
  "neither binary finished" is a statement about the cap, not evidence of
  inertness), `NOFILE`, `EMPTY_BOTH` — plus any allowlisted file that
  produced no row at all (checked as a set, so RESUME runs count correctly).
  An environment with no resolvable maude is `exit 2` at startup, not a sweep
  that scores every file `ERROR_BOTH`.
- **`triage_diff_vs_hs.sh`** — 3-way follow-up for `rs_vs_rs_diff` DIFFs:
  did the refactor move RS toward or away from HS? It reads and fills the
  batch gate's `.gate_cache/proof/` at `gate_common.sh`'s fingerprinted `ckey`,
  and runs all three binaries under the file's canonical `file_flags.tsv`
  flags — the flags the sweep that flagged the file used — so
  the three-way comparison is like-for-like and an entry it writes is one
  `corpus_file_diff.sh` reuses. Its fill follows the batch gate's discipline:
  rc beside the payload, nothing cached on a timeout, but no sticky
  `.timeout` markers (minting those is the gate's call). The oracle
  binary is required even on a warm cache — its fingerprint is part of the key
  — and missing is `exit 2`. Env: `PRE`, `POST`, `HS`, `CACHE`, `FLAGS_MAP`,
  `FT` (300 s), `DERIV` (30 s), `CORPUS`, `ROOT`.
- **`diff_proof_tree.sh`** + **`canon_proof_tree.py`** +
  **`corpus_diff_proof_trees.sh`** — STRUCTURAL proof-tree comparison from
  the pre-byte-parity era; superseded by the byte gates (identical bytes ⇒
  identical trees), only interesting when output diverges so grossly that
  byte diffs are unreadable.

## Maintenance & measurement

- **`bump_submodule.sh`** — submodule bump workflow: checks each entry in
  `patches/series`, rebuilds the oracle, refreshes the tamarin-server HTTP
  captures, remaps HS line cites across `crates/`, and prints a six-step
  re-certification checklist covering the divergence and CLI captures,
  batch/fast/flag gates, server tests, and web ladder. `SKIP_BUILD=1` also
  skips the HTTP capture and warns that it must be run explicitly. The gate
  caches are deliberately left alone (see the fingerprint note above — a
  rebuilt oracle turns every pre-bump entry into a MISS by key). `-h` prints its header; it
  and `divergence_fixtures/check.sh` are the only scripts here that answer one,
  so everywhere else the header comment is the interface.
- **`capture_cli_refs.sh`** — captures the ORACLE's stdout for every row of
  `crates/tamarin-prover/tests/fixtures/cli_refs/cases.tsv`, which is the argv
  table `cli_e2e.rs`'s flag pins read as well — adding a pin is "add a row,
  re-run this". Deliberately serial and proving: the oracle's `--prove` output
  is nondeterministic under parallel load, and a flaky reference is worse than
  none. Writes `<name>.stdout` (raw bytes; both sides normalise build info,
  `analyzed:` and the processing time at comparison time) plus `CAPTURED.tsv`
  (oracle path and fingerprint, submodule pin, maude version, per-row byte
  counts), which the tests assert lists exactly the rows in `cases.tsv`, so a
  partial capture cannot pass as a complete one. Ends in
  `DONE_CAPTURE_CLI_REFS verdict=<...> captured=N/M`, nonzero on any row that
  is missing, empty, or fails its `relation` column. Env: `HS_PATH`, `MAUDE`
  (its own harness-mirroring ladder, not the shared resolver — and not
  `MAUDE_PATH`), `FILE_TIMEOUT` (120 s), `ALLOW_ORACLE_REV_MISMATCH`.
- **`hpj_oracle.sh`** — the second oracle in this repo. It is the only oracle
  that is not the tamarin-prover binary.
  `crates/tamarin-theory/src/pretty_hpj.rs` ports GHC's `pretty` package. GHC
  9.6.7 ships exactly the version that the port targets, `pretty-1.1.3.6`.
  This script therefore derives an HPJ layout expectation from the real engine
  in one compile. You do not search the corpus for the expectation. You also do
  not capture it from the port, which is the worse of those two mistakes. For
  this reason, do not write a `contains('\n')` assertion in an HPJ test. The
  exact bytes cost seconds.

  To derive one expectation, run these two steps:

  ```
  scripts/hpj_oracle.sh --self-test            # 1. trust the toolchain
  scripts/hpj_oracle.sh -w 12 -r 12 \
    'fcat [text "<", text "aaa,", text "bbb,", text "ccc,", text "ddd", text ">"]'

  ```

  `-w` sets lineLength and `-r` sets the ribbon width. They are the same two
  numbers that `Doc::render_with(w, r)` takes. They default to the CLI's
  110/73, so a bare `Doc::render()` needs no flags. The server path is
  `-w 100 -r 67`. `one_line_render()` is `--one-line`. `render_at` has no
  equivalent, because it calls pretty's unexported `get1`. The output carries
  the rendered text twice. The `RUST` line carries it Rust-escaped, and
  non-ASCII characters stay UTF-8 there, unlike Haskell's `show`. The script
  also prints the text raw between markers. It prints that raw copy because
  this engine leaves trailing spaces before some breaks. Those spaces are part
  of the expected bytes.

  The script has two guards. Know both of them before you trust an answer.
  First, the resolved compiler's `pretty` must be 1.1.3.6. If it is not, the
  script stops. `HPJ_ALLOW_ANY_PRETTY=1` overrides that check. The script then
  prints a warning that the bytes are not an oracle expectation. Another
  release of `pretty` lays out documents differently, so a wrong answer here
  enters the tree as a pin. Second, `--self-test` derives six expectations that
  the port already asserts. This checks the toolchain. It adds no new coverage.
  If a case disagrees, then either the script does not run the right library
  or the port has regressed. In that case, do not commit anything that you
  derive in that session. One of the six cases carries a ribbon narrower than
  its line length. The other five cases all use `w == r`. The narrow case is
  necessary. With the five equal-width cases alone, a deliberate 4x error in
  the generated `ribbonsPerLine` goes undetected. `HPJ_GHC=<path>` picks the
  compiler. If `HPJ_GHC` names a compiler that the script cannot use, the
  script stops with an error. It never falls through to a different compiler.
  `--file Main.hs` runs a whole Haskell program verbatim. Use `--file` for a
  session that derives a dozen related cases with shared bindings.
- **`bench.sh`** — RS-vs-HS wall/RSS benchmark; emits the README's markdown
  tables.
- **`../prove_and_reverify.sh`** (repo root) — prove with tamarin-rs, re-check
  the emitted proofs with the Haskell prover; stdout is the re-verified proof
  file.

## Divergence fixtures — corners the corpus cannot reach

`divergence_fixtures/` covers observable behaviour that no theory under the
submodule's `examples/` tree exercises, so every corpus gate stays green
across a regression in it. These fixtures pin slice-level bytes against oracle
captures committed in-tree, so the check needs no oracle binary. The manifest
can also record an intentional divergence when one exists; currently every row
must match.

- **`divergence_fixtures/capture.sh`** — records the oracle's bytes for every
  fixture into `divergence_fixtures/expected/`. It resolves the oracle inside
  `tamarin-prover-testing/` and **refuses any binary whose baked git revision
  differs from the submodule pin** (same policy as
  `crates/tamarin-server/tests/capture_haskell_fixtures.sh`): these bytes are
  the reference, so a capture from another revision would silently redefine
  what the port is checked against. `--record-rs` additionally re-records the
  port side of any manifest row marked `diverge` — never a side effect.
- **`divergence_fixtures/check.sh`** — runs only the port and compares against
  those captures. Cheap (~5–10 s for all 55: no oracle, no proving), which is why
  CI runs it: the `test` job's `Divergence fixtures` step builds
  `--profile ci --bin tamarin-rs`, prepends `/opt/maude` to `PATH` (the port's
  own probe does not read `MAUDE_PATH`) and invokes it with an absolute
  `RS_PATH`, so a drift on any fixture or an `expected/oracle_rev` that is not
  the current submodule pin fails the build.
  It is not reachable by `cargo test` or by any corpus gate, so run it by hand
  too, next to `wf_gate.sh` and `pretty_gate.sh`.
- **`divergence_fixtures/fixtures.tsv`** — per fixture: which output slices are
  compared, whether the port must `match` the oracle or `diverge` from it, and
  the flags both engines get. Two slices exist, both load-time: `wf` =
  `wf_gate.sh`'s block and `theory` = `pretty_gate.sh`'s echo (several
  fixtures are cut from one theory load), and `slice()` dies on anything else.
  So "corners the corpus cannot reach" is covered for the two blocks a bare
  theory load prints, and not for the `--prove`, `--output-json`/`--output-dot`
  or interactive surfaces.

Today's fixtures, in manifest order:

- **`mixed_ac_wf`** — AC operands headed by *different* operators, rendered in
  a wellformedness message.
- **`pair_echo_order`** — two same-headed `pair` chains in one AC chain, whose
  order is decided below the head and is not by operand size.
- **`wf_user_ac_report`** — a user-declared `[AC]` symbol in a wellformedness
  message: its operand rank against the builtin AC operators, and its
  space-padded infix spelling.
- **`sapic_lowering`** — the SAPIC translation's `LNTerm` → parser-AST
  projection: infix `exp`, right-spine `pair` splitting.
- **`sapic_user_ac`** — a user-declared `[AC]` symbol inside a SAPIC process,
  reaching a `let`'s and an `if`'s derived rule names, generated restrictions
  and `process=` attributes.
- **`sapic_nullary_cond`** — a nullary function symbol inside a SAPIC
  conditional, reaching the derived rule and restriction names, the `process=`
  attribute and the AC-variant block.
- **`sapic_formula_terms`** — a SAPIC-generated restriction that fails the
  `Formula terms` check, to be picked out of two generated candidates.
- **`formula_terms_offenders`** — two offending lemmas sharing one `Formula
  terms` header, one of them naming two offenders, spelled by HS's `Show` for
  terms rather than by the pretty printer.
- **`wf_topic_interleave`** — a wellformedness topic that closes and reopens
  under a second header, because `formulaReports`' checks report per formula
  and not per topic. An earlier and a later check's entries bracket the run,
  so its position in the report is pinned as well as its internal order.
- **`guarded_name_collision`** — an inner binder sharing a name with an
  enclosing one, which stays guarded and keeps its `// safety formula` line.
- **`guarded_freshened_names`** — the names in the `unguarded variable(s) …`
  diagnostic, whose supply runs across the whole formula, against the pretty
  printer's own names for the same binders, whose supply is restored per
  quantifier. Lemmas only: the oracle dies while printing an unguardable
  restriction.
- **`mult_restricted_report`** — both triggers of the `Multiplication
  restriction of rules` check, one rule each: a product in a conclusion, and a
  reducible left-hand side whose abstraction orphans right-hand-side variables.
  The same rule is printed at two different widths in the two slices.
- **`ac_marker_collapse`** — a `tamXCA…`-named function, pinning the corrected
  upstream handling of singleton user-AC applications.
- **`dual_declared_names`** — one name declared BOTH as a NoEq funsym and as a
  user `[AC]` symbol: the prefix and `op{a}b` spellings resolve NoEq, the infix
  spelling stays AC, and a bare nullary name the NoEq constant.
- **`dual_declared_exp`** — the same collision against a symbol the BUILTINS
  contribute (`exp/2` under `diffie-hellman`), so prefix `exp(a,b)` renders
  `a^b` and is a reducible Formula-terms offender while infix `a exp b` is not.
- **`dual_declared_equations`** — an `equations:` left-hand side written prefix
  over such a name: the equation registers under the NoEq symbol and makes it
  reducible.
- **`naryapp_arity_folds`** — `naryOpApp`'s argument-list shapes: an arity-1
  head folding its commas into a right-associative pair (function and macro
  heads alike), an arity-0 head applied as `f()`, and a trailing comma.
- **`ac_prefix_arities`** — prefix and `op{t1}t2` applications of a user `[AC]`
  symbol, whose arity check is skipped: any argument count parses, and the
  singleton application collapses to its argument.
- **`positional_ac_prefix`** — the same name declared `[AC]` and then NoEq, with
  a use between the two declarations and a use after both: prefix resolution
  reads the signature built so far, so the two uses render differently.

Every current fixture must reproduce the pinned oracle's bytes. `check.sh`
still requires an explicit shape assertion before any future intentional
divergence can be added.

`bump_submodule.sh`'s checklist lists both scripts: `capture.sh` re-reads the
fixtures from the new oracle, and `git diff divergence_fixtures/expected/` is
then upstream behaviour moving under them.

## Licensing / attribution

- **`gen_license_headers.py`** — maintains the constant GPL notice on every
  file whose upstream citations resolve (no blame needed; `--check` for
  CI-style staleness, `--preview FILE` for one file). `--authors FILE`
  computes that file's pending-permission author list on demand
  (range-blame over its cited spans at the pinned submodule commit).
- **`extend_anchor_citations.py`** — rewrites bare `Foo.hs:162` citations
  into function-extent ranges (`Foo.hs:150-183, see line 162`) so blame
  scopes stay accurate.
- **`remap_hs_cites.py`** — remaps every HS line cite in crates/ comments
  across a submodule bump (`--old <pin> --new <pin> [--apply]`): pure line
  shifts applied mechanically, moved declarations re-anchored by name,
  ambiguous cites reported for a human pass. Run automatically by
  `bump_submodule.sh`.
- **`check_hs_cites.py`** — checks every `Foo.hs:N` cite against the pinned
  submodule. It reads the cites in `crates/**/*.rs` comments **and in every
  hand-written `*.spthy`**. It reads those theories under `crates/`, under
  `divergence_fixtures/`, and under `../tests/wellformedness_fixtures/`. The
  submodule's own corpus is out of scope. The script exits nonzero on a
  finding. The first five finding classes are MISSING, AMBIGUOUS, RANGE, BLANK
  and COMMENT. AMBIGUOUS is a bare basename that names two upstream files, so
  its line number is uncheckable. The sixth class is SEELINE (a
  `see line N` outside the extent it annotates). Nothing else catches a cite
  that has drifted — `remap_hs_cites.py` reports ambiguity rather than
  failing on it — so this is the post-bump gate, run automatically by
  `bump_submodule.sh` at the end of a bump (findings land in the cite-remap
  report). `--crate NAME` and `--skip CLASS` are repeatable; the whole tree
  is currently at zero findings.

  The `.spthy` half matters for one reason. A divergence fixture's header is a
  paragraph-long argument about upstream behaviour, and it cites that
  behaviour line by line. It is the one place where a reader checks a
  divergence claim. A second lexer (`lex_spans_spthy`) reads the fixtures. The
  Rust lexer does not read them. The comment forms are the same in both lexers:
  `//` and nested `/* */`, per `spthyStyle` in `Theory/Text/Parser/Token.hs`.
  A theory's `'psk'` is a single-quoted string. Rust's lexer reads a `'` as the
  start of a lifetime, so it walks into such a string. It then misreads a cite
  inside a public name as commentary and reports that cite as a finding.

  Know one asymmetry at bump time. `remap_hs_cites.py` walks `crates/**/*.rs`
  only, so it does not shift the fixtures' cites. Name the fixtures on its
  command line to remap the `//` ones
  (`remap_hs_cites.py --old … --new … scripts/divergence_fixtures/*.spthy`).
  Cites inside a fixture's `/* */` header are outside that tool's plain
  `//`/`#` scan. Correct those cites by hand. In both cases, the checker turns
  a drifted fixture cite into a finding. It never leaves such a cite
  unreported.

  header generator.

## Data files (tracked)

- **`file_flags.tsv`** — canonical per-file extra prover flags, applied
  identically to both engines and folded into the
  cache key as a hash so two flag sets on one theory are distinct entries.
  Its whole vocabulary today is `--auto-sources` (22 files),
  `--stop-on-trace=seqdfs` (8), `--diff` (5) and `-D` (4). 32 corpus
  theories contain `#ifdef`; the four `-D` rows put the DEFINED branch of
  `testParser/define.spthy` and three `thesis-LaraSchmid-evoting` theories in
  front of every gate that reads this file — and take their bare branch out of
  reach in exchange. Web gates use the separate `web_flags.tsv` contract, so
  `--auto-sources` reaches both interactive loaders, while batch-only
  `--diff` recipes cannot leak into one server while the other runs bare. The other 28 still prove one
  branch only. The value must
  be ATTACHED (`-D=A`, never `-D A`): `-D` is a cmdargs `flagOpt` in the
  Haskell binary, which reads a detached value as a positional input file,
  and the Rust port's clap front end deliberately mirrors that (a detached
  token stays positional there too).
- **`web_flags.tsv`** — the much smaller canonical interactive recipe map. It
  contains only flags accepted by both servers; unsupported entries fail as
  `SKIP_UNSUPPORTED_FLAGS`. Files whose special recipe is batch-only are opened
  bare in the web gate by explicit contract, rather than by filtering a batch
  command line.
- **`parity_corpus.txt`** — the canonical 432-file gate corpus: the
  submodule's examples plus one repo-local fixture
  (`../../crates/tamarin-theory/tests/fixtures/nat_sort_regression.spthy`,
  the only Nat+reuse theory — no upstream example combines the two).
  Entries resolve against `CORPUS_ROOT`, so `../..`-relative paths reach
  files outside the submodule; the caches key on content, not path.
- **`parity_corpus_fast.txt`** — the 365-file CI subset: every parity file
  proving in ≤1.5 s (plus the fastest member of otherwise-absent families);
  sized so a GitHub runner finishes in minutes.
- **`ci_ref_fast.tsv`** — committed reference for `rs_ref_check.sh`: per file,
  a full canonical theory/dependency/flags input digest and the sha256 of main's stripped
  `--prove` stdout. Its header records the maude version `check` enforces and,
  from the next `generate` on, the oracle/execution fingerprints and exact
  scope/proof-output certificate plus the `--certified-by` log that justified the
  re-baseline. A `file_flags.tsv` change makes the affected rows
  `INPUT_CHANGED` until it is regenerated — which the four new `-D` rows
  currently are.
- **`sweep_expected.tsv`** — the flag sweeps' residual ledger, applied
  mechanically by `apply_ledger` (see the sweeps above); its own header
  documents the column layout and every class. A `timeout/kill` entry
  documents a row rather than excusing it: those terminate as `UNCOMPARED`.
- **`pe_family.txt`** / **`module_family.txt`** / **`json_family.txt`** — the
  `FAMILY=1` subsets, one representative per divergence class.
- **`websweep_residual.txt`** — the accepted web-parity residue *path list*
  (witness-index family). No gate reads it any more: the machine-checked form
  is `websweep_ledger.tsv` below, and `pane_byte_check.sh` no longer defaults
  to this file (it was a *selection* list where a DIFF is expected, not a
  corpus to hold to byte parity).
- **`websweep_ledger.tsv`** — the web-parity residue ledger `web_parity.sh`
  applies mechanically (path / class / symptom / note): documented
  DIFF/MISSING rows report `LEDGERED`, entries that excuse nothing fail the
  verdict (LEDGER-STALE / LEDGER-SHADOWED / not-in-corpus), and a malformed
  ledger aborts the gate before it crawls anything. Its own header documents
  the columns and classes.
